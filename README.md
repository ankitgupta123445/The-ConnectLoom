# The ConnectLoom
The main Objective of this project is to manage the details of Remainder, Mobiles, Phone Numbers, People, Address. The Project is totally built at administrative end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access. In management terminology, advanced managers can be called individual resource management (IRM) tools â€“ systems for managing an individual's interactions with current and future contacts, to organize, collaborate, and synchronize health, lifestyle, and financial needs.
It stores contacts in very efficient way and provides a smarter way of handling contacts with fully Authentication and Authorization. We created this project using Spring Boot Thymeleaf with MVC Architecture and for Authentication and Authorization we have used Spring Security.

- Spring Boot is used to develop back-end and Spring Data JPA is used for performing Database CRUD operations.
- HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Thymeleaf as template Engine is used to develop the front end.
- MySQL for Database.
